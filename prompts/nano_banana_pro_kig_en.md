Use my uploaded image as the only reference. Perform a material and medium conversion; the content and composition must remain completely unchanged.

Target output: a “real camera-shot RAW photo look” kigurumi cosplay finished image (photorealistic, camera-captured, RAW photo look). It must NOT be an illustration, NOT animation, NOT CG/3D rendering, and it must NOT have any AI smudge / paint-over feeling.

【Neutral color / white balance must be enforced early (avoid warm toy cast)】
White balance must be neutral daylight (D65), around 5200K–6000K. No warm/orange/yellow cast, no tungsten vibe, no “creamy warm product photo” look. Keep background white neutral (not yellowish). Preserve the reference colors, but avoid overly saturated “candy” hair; subtle desaturation is allowed only for realism without changing hue.

【Strict kigurumi definition (must follow exactly)】
Real-world kigurumi cosplay: the performer wears a full-coverage tight zentai bodysuit (lycra/spandex) + gloves + foot covers, with absolutely no skin exposed; the head is an animegao kigurumi hard mask (resin/FRP), with a fine semi-matte surface, showing realistic reflections and tiny imperfections; the mask facial features (eye shape, iris color, eyebrow shape, mouth shape, blush/highlight placement) must strictly replicate the reference; the performer wears a real fiber wig, with clearly visible strands, and the hairstyle must be completely identical.
（着ぐるみ／アニメ顔面（アニメ顔 着ぐるみ面）／ゼンタイ）

【100% identical to the reference (must not change)】
Identity features, hair shape and hair color, expression, outfit design and every pattern/color/edge detail, all accessories and props, pose and hand gestures, body proportions, standing position, camera angle, crop/framing, lighting direction, and the background scene elements and their positional relationships must all remain 1:1 identical. Do not add, remove, or replace any element.

【Only allowed change: anime-style → realistic kigurumi materials】
Convert the “anime/2D character” in the reference into a real kigurumi cosplayer:

* Head: a high-quality animegao kigurumi hard mask. The mask’s eye shape, iris color, eyebrows, mouth, blush/highlight placement and shapes must strictly replicate the reference.
  IMPORTANT: the eye area may show realistic highlights and subtle reflections ONLY as a thin coating/lamination on the mesh/printed layers (or slight surface sheen), but it must NOT resemble a transparent lens, and must NOT change the eye shape or colors.
  （重要：反射＝メッシュや印刷層の薄いコーティングの反射／透明レンズではない）
* Wig: real synthetic fiber hair; hair volume, length, curl, parting sections, gradients, and hair accessories must be completely identical.
  （ウィッグ、人工毛）
* Body: a full-coverage zentai tight bodysuit (lycra/spandex), with gloves and foot covers connected or seamlessly integrated; the fabric must show realistic weave texture, mild specular reflection, natural wrinkles and stretch marks; hidden zippers/closures are allowed but must not alter the appearance of the reference (the zipper must be hidden on the back or in an unobtrusive place).
  （ゼンタイ、ライクラ／スパンデックス）
* Clothing layers: if the reference includes outerwear/skirt/cape/scarf etc., render them with real-world craftsmanship: visible stitching, edge binding, topstitching, realistic embroidery or printing process, and correct material separation for metal/plastic parts.

【Anti-“figurine” constraints (most important)】

* It must be a “life-size human” scene: real ground contact shadows, correct perspective scale, consistent human-to-environment scale; absolutely no “miniature model / tabletop object” scale feeling.
  （等身大、ミニチュア禁止）
* The texture must read as “worn by a real person”: clearly visible fabric weave, stitching, bindings, natural wrinkles and stretch; include slight realistic imperfections such as tiny lint/dust/pilling from fabric friction (but not dirty and not ruining the look).
* Lighting must be “photographic studio light / natural light”: natural shadow edges and environment reflections; avoid flat uniform lighting; do not look like e-commerce toy product photography.
  （物撮りっぽさ禁止）
* Edges must be clean and sharp: no oil-paint feel, no smudging, no beauty-smoothing; avoid plastic shine.

【Key fix: the animegao kigurumi mask face must be a real-world mask, not figurine rendering】
The mask face must show evidence of being a real manufactured object, not a 3D-rendered surface:

* Material: resin/FRP hard shell + clear coat. IMPORTANT: the clear coat must be satin / semi-matte / matte (NOT glossy), with a fine micro-texture that breaks up highlights. The surface must show realistic micro orange-peel / micro-grain (micro-texture) and subtle “matte scatter” (diffuse specular), not a perfectly polished smooth plastic finish. Avoid the look of a sanded-and-polished painted figurine.
  （クリアコート＝サテン／半ツヤ～マット／鏡面禁止／表面の微細な梨地）
* Specular behavior: highlights must be softer and more spread (bloomed/scattered) on the mask face, not sharp mirror-like hotspots; still physically plausible under studio lights. The highlight shape should look like satin clear-coat on resin/FRP, not toy plastic gloss.Do NOT blur or smear details; keep crisp micro-texture while the highlight is diffused.
  （ハイライトは柔らかく拡散／ギラつき禁止）
* Real reflections: the highlight shapes must match the light source direction and reflect the environment (visible blurred softbox/window-frame reflections); highlight edges must transition naturally; forbid “uniform toy-like shine.”Reflections must appear softened by satin clear-coat, not mirror-like.
* Real imperfections: extremely subtle hairline scratches, tiny dust specks, paint layer variations, and subtle spray boundaries (very subtle but visible). Avoid a perfectly flawless CG surface.
* Real construction: mask edge thickness must be real, with chamfers; visible seams/joints or foam-liner pressure marks are allowed (without changing the design, only to make it feel real); the neck connection to the hood/wig must be physically plausible.
  （継ぎ目、フォーム内装の圧痕）
* STRUCTURE CRITICAL: there must be a clear physical break/seam between the hard mask shell and the neck covering. The mask edge must show real rim thickness and chamfer, forming an explicit boundary line (seam line / small gap). The neck must be covered by a separate hood/balaclava/neck seal (fabric), with a visible step difference, occlusion shadow, and obvious material change (hard shell vs fabric). Do NOT blend mask and neck into a smooth continuous surface; it must look like a real mask worn on top of a separate neck covering.
  （首の継ぎ目／面の縁／段差／ネックシール）
* Eye realism: the eyes must read as printed/laminated parts / surface layers (if the reference eyes are flat, keep the shape unchanged); allow slight surface reflection and a surface layer feel ONLY if it reads as mesh/print coating, not as a clear lens; do not look like “rendered glass-ball eyes.”
  （ガラス玉目禁止／透明レンズ禁止）
* Keep the facial design strictly identical; only change materials and real-world craftsmanship so the face looks truly photographed.

【Key: kigurumi eyes must be a “mesh layered structure,” not flat drawing, and not a transparent acrylic lens】【must follow】
The eyes must show a real kigurumi mask “layered construction + depth/parallax,” explicitly as see-through mesh eyes:

* The eye structure consists of “recessed eye socket + micro-hole mesh layer + 3D eyelashes/eyeliner structure + (optional) extremely thin coating reflections,” with clear front-to-back layering and occlusion relationships.
  （メッシュ目、奥まった眼窩）
* Mesh layer: the outer layer is a dark micro-perforated mesh/fine netting (micro-perforated mesh / fine netting), with dense tiny holes; on close look, the mesh grid and micro-holes are discernible. This is for internal vision. It is absolutely not a clear acrylic/glass lens.
  （メッシュ、微細孔）
* Iris/pupil/sclera graphics must strictly match the reference shape and colors, but appear as “printed on the mesh layer or located behind it at a deeper layer”: the mesh holes create subtle grain, weave texture, and slight moiré; it cannot look like a smooth flat decal/texture.
  （モアレ、織り目）
* Eyelashes must be 3D implanted/false-lash strips with visible strands/bundles; there must be a distance between lashes and the mesh layer; lashes must cast very fine micro-shadows onto the mesh/eye area to reinforce real depth.
  （植毛まつげ、微小影）
* Eye socket and eyelid rim must have real thickness and recessed occlusion shadows; the mesh layer sits within the socket, forming depth: “foreground lashes — mid-layer mesh — background iris graphics.”
* Real optics and reflections: the eye area may have blurred softbox/window reflections and highlights, but the reflections must read as mesh/coating/wet-surface highlights, NOT as refraction of a clear lens, and NOT as CG glass-ball eyes.
  (Highlights are allowed; transparent lens refraction is forbidden.)
  （ハイライトはOK／透明レンズ屈折はNG）
* Strictly forbid: clear lenses/glass eyes/crystal eyes/acrylic lens look; CG-perfect smooth toy eyes; flat printed eyes; “flat eyes” with no eyelash shadow.

【Key: the animegao mask face must have harder, more dimensional real-photo lighting, with real physical evidence】【forbid figurine/render feel】
The animegao mask face is a resin/FRP hard shell + clear coat. Highlights are more concentrated and cleaner, shadow transitions are more defined; the dimensionality may be stronger than human skin but not exaggerated. Overall it must look like a real mask photographed in the real world, not a figurine render.

* The clear coat surface must show real specular highlights and micro-texture (very subtle orange peel), and must include real manufacturing evidence: extremely subtle hairline scratches, tiny dust specks, paint-layer boundaries or spray edges (realistic but not dirty), and must avoid a perfectly flawless CG surface.
* Highlights must show real photographic environment reflections: blurred shapes of softboxes/window frames; highlight edges must transition naturally; forbid “uniform shiny plastic toy light” or “product rendering light.”
* Shadow edges may be slightly crisper (hard shell property), but must follow real lighting logic: plausible key/fill/ambient reflection relationships; do not evenly “paint the entire face bright,” and do not use painterly smoothing.
* Blush/highlight placement and shapes on the mask must strictly match the reference, but must look like real sprayed/painted layers with subtle spray grain and layering, not perfect CG gradients.

【Camera straight-out-of-camera look constraints (critical)】

* The image must include real photographic micro-detail: clear high-frequency textures (fabric weave, stitching, subtle mask surface texture, tiny dust/hairline scratches, natural highlight transitions).
* Preserve natural micro-contrast and sharpness: clean crisp edges, not blurry, not painterly, not beauty-smoothed, not plastic-looking.
* Real optical imaging: natural depth of field, realistic focus plane, realistic lens breathing feel and slight vignetting (if consistent with the reference), dynamic range like camera RAW.
* Add subtle and natural fine film/sensor grain; do not over-denoise.

【Wig / hair must look like real photographed hair fibers (critical)】
The wig must look like a real synthetic fiber wig: individually readable strands, random splits and fine layering; small flyaways and slight fuzz on edges; hair highlights must show real anisotropic hair shine (thin broken streak highlights along hair direction), not uniformly painted shine.
The wig must have real contact with the hat/hood/mask: slight pressure marks, local occlusion shadows, strands bending due to compression; root/parting/wig-net darker details can be naturally visible but not overemphasized.
Keep the hairstyle and hair color consistent with the reference (slightly lower saturation is allowed to increase realism), and only improve realistic hair fiber details and camera look; avoid CG render hair feel and “plastic hair sheet” feel.

【Photography parameters (to look more like a camera photo)】
Full-frame DSLR/mirrorless, 50mm or 85mm lens look, f/2.8–f/4 depth of field, 1/125s, ISO 200–800, neutral white balance, realistic flash or softbox lighting (if indoor) OR natural daylight (if outdoor). Crisp focus, high detail, no beauty retouch.
